Mavericks
========================================================

I just upgraded to OSX Mavericks and RStudio Preview.  I like the RStudio Presentation mode and saw that they added a new R-HTML type document (along with a pres document).  I'm a big fan of Shiny, but thought that the live preview in the plots page was pretty slick.  

Now, with Mavericks, my X11 went crazy.  I had just installed XQuartz when upgrading to Mountain Lion, but when Knitting, I was having it come up with X11 problems, and X11 windows would not load when I was working on my cluster interactive sessions.

I'm ugrading now, but I just wanted to note that re-installing XQuartz is good on the X11.  After installing the "new" RStudio, it pretty much exactly became a Glimmer or Spark Session where you're interacting with all menus from RStudio and nothing from the Mac toolbar (which I knew going into downloading).  It's not lagging as it was with the previous RStudio version, so if you upgraded to Mavericks, download immediately.  If not, and use R regularly [http://hopstat.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/knitr-and-wordpress-test/](especially for things like making posts with knitr!), I'd hold off
