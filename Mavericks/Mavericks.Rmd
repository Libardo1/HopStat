Mavericks and RStudio
========================================================

I just upgraded to OSX Mavericks and RStudio Preview.  I like the RStudio Presentation mode and saw that they added a new R-HTML type document (along with a pres document).  I'm a big fan of Shiny, but thought that the live preview in the plots page was pretty slick.  

Now, with Mavericks, my X11 went crazy.  I had just installed XQuartz when upgrading to Mountain Lion, but when Knitting, I was having it come up with X11 problems, and X11 windows would not load when I was working on my cluster interactive sessions.  I [Googled around](http://superuser.com/questions/664531/x11-xquartz-wont-auto-launch-after-upgrading-to-os-x-mavericks) for X11 solution. After re-installing XQuartz, it's all good on the X11 front.  

I also found that RStudio is [slow](http://blog.rstudio.org/2013/10/22/rstudio-and-os-x-10-9-mavericks/). After installing the "new" RStudio, it pretty much exactly became a Glimmer or Spark Session where you're interacting with all menus from RStudio and nothing from the Mac toolbar (which I knew going into downloading).  It's not lagging as it was with the previous RStudio version, so if you upgraded to Mavericks, download immediately.  If not, and use R regularly [(especially for things like making posts with knitr!)](http://hopstat.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/knitr-and-wordpress-test/), I'd hold off on the Mavericks update until RStudio fixes the issues.
