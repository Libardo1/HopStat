Teach Confidence Intervals as Weather
========================================================


So a while ago, [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/10/30/on-weather-forecasts-nate-silver-and-the/) discussed how to look at Nate Silver's percentage estimates as weather forecasts, and I liked the post.  So the [Weather Channel](http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/24439-weather-com-what-do-the-different-percentages-of-) describes what they mean by "a 40% chance of percipitation", but the quote at the end is most relevant:
>[T]here is only a 40% chance that anyone in [the areai in question] will receive precipitation.

I think we should really teach student confidence intervals in the same capacity. We can think of it this way: the "area" is over a repeated experiments - your geographic area are repeated experiments and the we have an rain meter (or an estimator, in our case the confidence interval) for each of the areas.  In the weather case, if the percentage is truly 40%, we think, on average, that 40% of the rain meters will have colected rain (cover the true parameter).  Now for each individual rain meters, they either collected rain or they did not, just like if there is a true parameter, the confidence interval either covered it or did not.
